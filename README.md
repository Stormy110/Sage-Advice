## Chuck Norris API
"https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random"

This API will send a random Chuck Norris joke. We manipulated the DOM so that every time you go to the page called 'BODY', a Chuck Norris joke will appear along with an image of Chuck Norris.
We used some CSS animations on the header and paragraph and added a greyscale effect to the image. The background color scheme is a gradient pattern that loops.

## Mind
The mind page uses the Advice Slip API found here: https://api.adviceslip.com/#top
It grabs a random piece of advice provided by the API and displays it on the page.
It has the same styling as the body and soul pages.

## Soul

We got our APi from "https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random"
It is from the dog.ceo website which generates random images of cute dogs. It has the same styling as the body and the soul pages.
