### Chuck Norris API
# "https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random"

# This API will send a random Chuck Norris joke. We manipulated the DOM so that every time you go to the page called 'BODY', a Chuck Norris joke will appear along with an image of Chuck Norris.
# We used some CSS animations on the header and paragraph and added a greyscale effect to the image. The background color scheme is a gradient pattern that loops.
